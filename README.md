# Task-Management-Console-App

A Simple Task Management Application (C++)

## Overview

This project is a command-line based Task Management Application built using C++. It allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently. The application utilizes object-oriented principles to organize tasks into categories (optional) and provides functionalities to add, list, mark tasks as complete, and set due dates.

This project was developed as a learning exercise to solidify understanding of fundamental C++ concepts such as classes, functions, inheritance (optional), header files, and basic input/output operations. It aims to demonstrate good coding practices and a structured approach to software development.

## Features

* **Task Creation:** Add new tasks with a name and optional description.
* **Task Listing:** View a list of all tasks, including their status (complete/incomplete).
* **Mark Task as Complete:** Update the status of a task to indicate completion.
* **Set Due Date:** Assign a due date to a task.
* **Categorization (Optional):** Organize tasks into different categories.
* **List Tasks by Category (Optional):** Filter and display tasks belonging to a specific category.
* **User-Friendly Command-Line Interface:** Simple text-based menu for easy interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., g++, clang++).

### Compilation

1.  Clone the repository (if applicable):
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [project_directory]
    ```

2.  Compile the source files. You might need to adjust the command based on your compiler and how you've structured your project. Here's a common example using g++:
    ```bash
    g++ src/*.cpp -o task_manager
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  Execute the compiled binary:
    ```bash
    ./task_manager
    ```

2.  Follow the on-screen menu prompts to interact with the application.
